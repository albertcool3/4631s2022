This pair of articles describes a technique for checking for any impurities in a sample of water using a smartphone. Professor Tam Vu's article serves as an introduction and summary to the research done by a group of computer scientists  at MIT. The second article explains in detail how liquid's properties can be related to surface tension which can be measured by the wavelength of the waves induced by the vibrations from the smartphone. The wave picutre taken by the smartphone is used calculate the wavelengths. But to do it accurately, the scientist has to overcome the rolling shutter effects on the smartphone.
