News of tech giants' monopolies and controversies have been making headlines in recent years. Prof. Doctorow’s article tries to analyze the root cause and question the current “solution” trend. The technology market demands Interoperability for all players to utilize innovation, cooperation. The author analyzes indifferent interoperability, cooperative interoperability, and competitive compatibility with the main focus on the latter. The author believes that “fixing” tech giants is not the solution to today’s security and privacy issues by making them even more central and permanent. 

For years, governments and the general public have had huge concerns over the superpowers of tech giants like Apple and Google.  Prof. Larus’ argument adds such views even further with the most recent battles around Covid-19 applications.  By looking into how the different Covid-19 apps were built around constraints that Apple and Google set on smartphones, the author expressed strong concern and even opposition to such complete and unquestioned controls.
