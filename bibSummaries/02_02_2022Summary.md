Since the video is discussed during the class, I read the correspsonding article (by Philip H.Kindt et al) described by the video, another related article (by Gwanhoo Lee et al). The first paper suggests that the covid tracking system used in smartphones apps does not work very well. This seems to contridict the huge success described by the second paper. The approach described by the first paper relies on citizens install a smarphone application voluntarily and the second paper describes how the Korean government tracks their citizens (without a smartphone app being installed on the phone) using cell phone location data (from phone companies) and credit card information from financial institutions.
