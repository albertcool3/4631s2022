General public has been waiting for self-driving cars for years, especially after Tesla came into the market. However, according to the author, fully autonomous vehicles are at least a decade away. The author examines the state of self-driving cars today and technical hurdles of the development of accurate sensors and cameras as well as the data-intensive algorithms. Many potential solutions are being developed by development teams from big automobile names to startups, but significant work still remains to allow self-driving systems to function safely in all driving scenarios. In addition, government regulations are also challenging. In summary, despite the huge expectations, we won't see fully autonomous driving systems anytime soon.

We now live in a society where technology is almost essential in everyday life. Itâ€™s apparent that technology empowers us to a degree we never enjoyed before. On the other hand, it can bring out our worst behaviors. Unsurprisingly, the author takes on the notorious example of Facebook who knowingly served content containing hate speech and misinformation to its users. According to multiple experts whom the article references to, technology and AI influence human neurochemistry which affects human moral behaviors. Technology creators always focus on innovation over its impact on morality,  which should be designed as a feature instead of treated as a bug.
