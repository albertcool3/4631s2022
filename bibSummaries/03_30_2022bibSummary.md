Artificial intelligence provides innovations in every perspective in today’s world. However, this article expresses huge concerns about AI-driven education. The author references a 1957 science-fiction story to indicate that AI could deprive human being’s ability to produce original thoughts like reading books. The author is also concerned with the motivation and ethics of such education. He strongly recommends these concerns be addressed for AI applications in education.

Hunger is becoming a more serious issue with the explosion of the planet’s population. The article discusses Artificial intelligence as one of solutions to address such problems. First of all, Agrobots, intelligent and autonomous robots in agriculture, increase crop yields by working both faster and longer than humans. AI techniques are also key to detect and predict diseases in crops. Such capabilities can feed into precision for targeted application of the necessary treatment. The author also recognizes that full automation is unlikely for complex labor-intensive crop sectors. The future lands in collaborative and inclusive human-AI partnership.
