The Internet is a melting pot covering the digital universe from governments to corporations to institutes to consumers etc.. Itâ€™s really embedded in every walk of our lives. While the internet has empowered and benefitted the modern world like never before, the author wants to highlight the importance of preserving such benefits and diminishing harmful abuses. The article emphasizes the safety and security of the Internet environment and advocates stronger defensive measures in the technical infrastructures. This is a very complex task for decades ahead.

Big data in AI and machine learning have augmented human capacity in unimaginable ways. Yet, in reality removing data from an existing algorithm and model is extraordinarily difficult without retraining the entire model which is an expensive and time-consuming process. The author introduces a research which uses the method called Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA). It divides training data into multiple disjoint shards which makes unlearning data elements much less expensive. This approach has brought a lot of attention even with its limitation according to the authors and researchers from other prominent universities.
